this record the way i learn Ubuntu.
interest is the best teacher，learn Linux system is a difficult work.so how to learn is a valuable question that we should consider.

First, you should install some general packages,know about some command that we often use to install package.
of course, we must inquire the mean of the command by baidu or Google when we use them.
then, we should collect some shortcuts, drop the mouse，in order to promote the ability that we contrl the computer.find some material
and edit it to table, next print it. After complete that, what should we do, you see some confuse, there have many choices.but you‘d
better follow my addvice, to try some thing interesting.so we learn how to make our theme of the system beautiful.the MAC OSX is a 
good choice.
